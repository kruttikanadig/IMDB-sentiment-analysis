### Achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with BERT

I applied NLP techniques to 50k IMDB movie reviews with binary sentiment labels, and trained and evaluated three models for sentiment classification (XGBoost, LSTM and BERT base). BERT achieved 93.57% test accuracy on the Google Colab 12GB GPU after fine-tuning, which is close to state-of-the-art results.
